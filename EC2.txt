THEORY:
-EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service by AWS that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers.
-Instances are categorized by use cases like compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and general-purpose. 
-On-Demand: Pay for compute capacity by the hour/second with no long-term commitments.
-Reserved: Reserve an instance for 1 or 3 years at a reduced rate
-Spot: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at reduced rates

-The states include Pending, Running, Stopping, Stopped, Shutting-down, and Terminated.

-Security Groups act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances, ensuring network security.

-A key pair consists of a public and private key that ensures secure access to EC2 instances.

-IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls access to AWS resources, allowing you to create users, roles, and permissions for secure resource management.

-CloudWatch is an AWS monitoring service to track metrics and logs, set alarms, and respond to changes in your resources.
