theory: 
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to run code in response to events.
 This on-demand function execution model provides benefits like automatic scaling, high availability, and a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which only charges for the time code is running.

To package a Java Lambda function, you compile it into a JAR file using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
